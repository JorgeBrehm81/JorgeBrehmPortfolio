# JorgeBrehmPortfolio

Welcome to my portfolio! This repository showcases my projects in the field of data science, machine learning, and data analysis. Each project folder contains the necessary code, notebooks, datasets, and documentation for a specific project. Feel free to explore the projects and learn more about my work.

## About Me
I'm a Data science and mathematics engineer student currently working as a data engineer @ Crystal System Americas. Huge fan of sports and how data science is used to help decision making based on facts, stats and probabilities instead of opinions.
