# WC Analytics: Mexico

This was my first project regarding football analytics. Thanks to the workshop 
"Learning to analyze soccer data with python" given by Ricardo Larrandart and Martha Mayela Reyna Fuentes from
StatsBomb_ES I was able to make my first soccer visualizations. In this workshop we worked with data from 
Qatar 2022 World Cup, I decided to play a little with the data to analyze the match between Mexico against 
the world champion Argentina.

Before being able to make the visualizations of how mexican players performed against Argentina. 
The data was pre-processed first.
